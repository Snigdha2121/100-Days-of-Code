        "**What Are Conditional Statements?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on conditions. They let you execute specific blocks of code when certain conditions are met, enabling you to make decisions and handle different scenarios within your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Syntax of Conditional Statements\n",
        "The basic syntax for conditional statements is as follows:\n",
        "### `if` Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition:\n",
        "    # code to execute if the condition is True\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### `if-else` Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is `True` and another block if the condition is `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition:\n",
        "    # code to execute if the condition is True\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    # code to execute if the condition is False\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### `if-elif-else` Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The `if-elif-else` statement allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially and execute code blocks based on which condition is `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition1:\n",
        "    # code to execute if condition1 is True\n",
        "elif condition2:\n",
        "    # code to execute if condition1 is False and condition2 is True\n",

        "    # code to execute if none of the above conditions are True\n",
        "```\n",

        "### Nested `if` Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Nested `if` statements are used when you need to evaluate multiple conditions within another `if` statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition1:\n",
        "    if condition2:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Multiple `if` Statements\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, multiple `if` statements are used when you want to check more than one condition independently. Each `if` statement is evaluated separately, and the code blocks associated with each condition will execute if their respective conditions are `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Syntax**\n",
