        "## **Description**\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"Treasure Island\" game is an interactive text-based adventure where the player makes choices to navigate through various scenarios in search of a treasure. The game tests decision-making skills and provides different outcomes based on user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How It Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Welcome Message:**\n",
        "   The game starts by greeting the player and outlining the mission to find the treasure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initial Choice:**\n",
        "   The player encounters a crossroads and must choose a direction: 'left' or 'right'.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Lake Scenario:**\n",
        "   If the player chooses 'left', they come to a lake with an island. They must decide to 'wait' for a boat or 'swim' across.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Island Choices:**\n",
        "   If the player decides to 'wait' and reaches the island, they find a house with three doors: red, yellow, and blue. They must choose one door.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Treasure Outcome:**\n",
        "   Based on the door choice:\n",
        "   - **Yellow Door:** The player finds the treasure and wins the game.\n",
        "   - **Red Door:** The player encounters a room full of fire and loses the game.\n",
        "   - **Blue Door:** The player faces a room of beasts and loses the game.\n",
        "   - **Invalid Choice:** The player chooses a non-existent door and loses the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Alternate Outcomes:**\n",
        "   If the player decides to 'swim' or chooses 'right', they encounter obstacles leading to a game over.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "The game uses nested `if` statements to create a branching narrative based on player choices, resulting in different scenarios and outcomes. This interactive adventure challenges the player to make strategic decisions to successfully find the treasure.\n"
