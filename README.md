# 100 Days of Code - Python

Welcome to my "100 Days of Code" repository! This is where I'll be documenting my journey of learning Python over the next 100 days. Each day, I'll be committing new code, solutions to exercises, and notes on what I've learned.

## Introduction

This repository is part of my commitment to learning Python and improving my coding skills over the next 100 days. Each day will be dedicated to a specific topic or exercise, and I will provide code snippets, explanations, and any relevant notes in the daily files.

## Daily Progress

You can find my daily progress in the `days` folder. Each day will be documented in its own folder named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `dayXX_code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the day's coding exercises or projects.
- `dayXX_notes.md`: Markdown file with notes and explanations about the day's work.


## Resources

Here is the resource that I'm using to guide my learning:
