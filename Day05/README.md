# Day 5: Python Notes

## Notes

### Loops: `while` and `for`
- **`while` Loop**: Describes how the `while` loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is `True`. Covers syntax and use cases.
- **`for` Loop**: Explains how the `for` loop iterates over a sequence and executes a block of code for each item. Includes syntax and scenarios where it is preferred.
- **Key Differences**: Highlights the differences between `while` and `for` loops, focusing on their respective use cases and applications.

### Function: `range()`
- **Description of `range()`**: Introduces the `range()` function and its purpose in generating a sequence of numbers.
- **Syntax and Parameters**: Details the syntax of `range(start, stop, step)` and explains each parameter (`start`, `stop`, `step`).
- **Usage Examples**: Provides examples of different `range()` usages and how they control the iteration in loops.

## Tasks

### FizzBuzz Game
- **Description and Functionality**: Explains the FizzBuzz game, where numbers from 1 to 100 are iterated and specific strings are printed based on divisibility by 3 and 5.
- **Code Explanation**: Details how the code checks divisibility and prints "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" based on the conditions.
- **Example Flow**: Provides a sample execution flow of the FizzBuzz game.

## Projects

### Password Generator
- **Overview**: Describes the Password Generator project, which creates passwords based on user-defined criteria such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.
- **Password Generator Using String**: Explains how the password is generated using string concatenation and shuffling.
- **Password Generator Using List**: Details how the password is created using a list, appending characters, shuffling, and converting the list back into a string.
- **Usage**: Outlines how users can input their requirements and receive a randomized password.
